                <pre id="code-display">Medea is a princess and an enchantress from Colchis, the daughter of King AeÃ«tes. She once was married to Jason but he betrayed her, leading to the awful decision of hers to kill her sons. She was overwhelmed with emotions and controlled with rage. After her murder she went to Athens and left her husband Jason in despair. This is not the only thing she has done, she also killed her brother just for her and Jason to escape. With all what happened she felt every possible pain mentally and emotionally. To add, Medea is also the granddaughter of the God Helios, the God of Sun who dashes through the sky with his Golden chariot pulled by four fiery pegasus. Medea rode this chariot to take her sons and leave Jason. To conclude, Medea was an enchantress that was of divine descent with a sad prophecy, she used her powers to tell Jason what he must do, but he used her for his own benefit.
